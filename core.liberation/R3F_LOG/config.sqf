 * There are two ways to manage new objects with the logistics system. The first one is to add these objects in the
 * following appropriate lists. The second one is to create a new external file in the /addons_config/ directory,
 * based on /addons_config/TEMPLATE.sqf, and to add a #include below to.
 * The first method is better to add/fix only some various class names.
 * The second method is better to take into account an additional addon.
 *
 * These variables are based on the inheritance principle according to the CfgVehicles tree.
 * It means that a features accorded to a class name, is also accorded to all child classes.
 * Inheritance tree view : http://madbull.arma.free.fr/A3_1.32_CfgVehicles_tree.html
